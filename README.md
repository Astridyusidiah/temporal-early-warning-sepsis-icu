# Temporal-Early-Warning-of-Sepsis-Deterioration-in-ICU-Patients
This project develops a temporal machine learning model to identify when ICU patients transition from low to high sepsis risk. Using time-series clinical data, the model captures evolving physiological patterns prior to clinical deterioration, supporting early warning rather than post-hoc diagnosis.
